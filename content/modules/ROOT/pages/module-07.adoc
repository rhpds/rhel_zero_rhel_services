The RHEL preupgrade analysis utility analyzes RHEL8 and RHEL7 hosts to
provide recommendations to minimize problems when upgrading to RHEL9.

First, we’ll provision a RHEL8 host. Then we’ll run the
`+RHEL preupgrade analysis utility+` against it.

Launch a vm from the `+summit-rhel8+` image. Do the following.

[arabic]
. Navigate to the `+Image Builder+` application.
. Click on `+Launch+`, next to the `+summit-rhel8+` image.

.launch rhel 8

The next menu will prefill several values to customize the VM instance.
We’ll need to choose the instance type `+t2.medium+` and click `+Next+`.

Select the SSH public key `+rhte_public_key+` and click `+Next+`.

.ssh key

Review the details before clicking `+Launch+`.

When your instance has launched successfully, copy down the ID, DNS, and
SSH command. In particular, save the SSH command.

*Do not close this window.*

You can save the SSH command in the built in `+Notepad+`.

Then click on the `+Notepad+` tab.

Paste the SSH command into the notepad and save it by clicking on the
disk icon.

`+RHEL preupgrade analysis utility+` in the `+Tasks+` menu under
`+Toolkit+`.

Click on `+Run task+`.

.run task

Select the RHEL8 system you just provisioned and click execute.

.execute

It will take a few minutes for the job to complete.

Go to the `+Activity+` tab and the last job run to view the analysis.

You might have to sort the Status and Run date/Time columns to find your
job.

.sort

Click on the task.

.completed

Expand the System name to view the report.

.analysis

This completes all lab activities.
