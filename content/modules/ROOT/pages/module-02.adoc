In this challenge we’ll show you how to configure custom repositories.
Custom repositories may be used to inject third party or custom RPMs
into images built with the Image builder application. This challenge is
optional as we will provide pre-configured custom repositories to be
used later in this lab.

Let’s navigate to the repositories menu.

Click on the `+Settings gear+` and click on `+Settings+`.

Click on `+Repositories+`

There are a few pre-configured repos.

*_At this point, you may add a custom repository or proceed to the next
step._*

If you would like to configure a custom repo, click on
`+Add repositories+` and fill in the wizard below.
