In the `+Image Builder+` menu, find the `+summit-test+` image. Click on
`+Launch+`.

.launch summit test
image::launchsummittest.png[launch summit test]

The next menu will prefill several values to customize the VM instance.
We’ll need to choose the instance type `+t2.medium+` and click `+Next+`.

.t2
image::t2medium.png[t2]

Select the SSH public key `+rhte_public_key+` and click `+Next+`.

.ssh key
image::sshkeyselection.png[ssh key]

Review the details before clicking `+Launch+`.

.review details launch
image::reviewdetailslaunch.png[review details launch]

When your instance has launched successfully, copy down the ID, DNS, and
SSH command. In particular, save the SSH command.

.instance launched
image::instancelaunched.png[instance launched]

*Do not close this window.*

You can save the SSH command in the built in `+Notepad+`.

Then click on the `+Notepad+` tab.

.notepad
image::notepadtab.png[notepad]

Click on `+/notes/notepad+`.

.notesnotepad
image::notesnotepad.png[notesnotepad]

Paste the SSH command into the notepad and save it by clicking on the
disk icon.

.save
image::savesshcommand.png[save]

Return to the Launch window.

.launched
image::instancelaunched.png[launched]

Clicking on the ID hyperlink will take you directly to the AWS console
instance information page.

AWS credentials will be provided in-session.

.aws console instance
image::awsconsoleinstance.png[aws console instance]

Note that the instance was assigned a *private* DNS name.

.private dns
image::privatednsname.png[private dns]

In the `+Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console+`, navigate to `+Inventory+`.

.inventory
image::inventory2.png[inventory]

Notice that the AWS instance appears in the inventory. Recall that we
configured the image to automatically register itself with Red Hat with
the activation key `+rhte+`. When we launched the VM instance in AWS, it
was automatically registered with this key.

*_NOTE:_* If you do not see your host immediately, wait a few minutes
and refresh your browser. It takes AWS a few minutes to provision the VM
and then a few more minutes for the host to contact Insights.

Let’s log into the instance via SSH.

Click on the `+Terminal+` tab.

.terminal tab
image::terminaltab.png[terminal tab]

In the terminal, SSH into the newly provisioned AWS instance. You can
copy the SSH command from the `+Notepad+`. It might take a little while
to connect so please be patient.

.ssh
image::sshinstance.png[ssh]

Let’s check the software we added during the image build process is in
good working order.

Switch to the root user.

[source,bash]
----
sudo -i
----

Let’s verify that we installed the `+ubi-init+` custom package
successfully from our custom repository `+CustomRepo+`. Run the
following command to check that a base image was added.

[source,bash]
----
podman image list
----

.image list
image::podmanimagelist.png[image list]

Run the image in podman.

[source,bash]
----
podman run e8f952a20c33 &
----

Check that the container is running.

[source,bash]
----
podman container list
----

.run container
image::containerrun.png[run container]

We’ve now demonstrated that we can build an image with the tools needed
for developers to create containerized workloads, using custom software
repositories. This workflow can be extended for other applications
including workloads such as MS SQL or SAP.
