We will now patch our system with patches that were published up to
December 31 by creating a patch template with a date of December 31,
2022.

First we’ll downgrade `+podman+`. In the `+Terminal+`, run the following
command.

[source,bash]
----
dnf -y downgrade podman
----

Now run the `+insights-client+`.

[source,bash]
----
insights-client
----

Go to the Systems menu in the Patch application.

.patch systems

You’ll see that the host has one installable advisory.

.installable advisory

Go to the Patch template application.

.patch template app

Click the `+Create a template+` button.

Perform the following tasks in the `+Create content template+` menu.

[arabic]
. Pick the date `+2022-12-31+`.
. Click `+Next+`.

Do the following in `+Details+`.

[arabic]

. Click `+Next+`.

In the `+Systems+` menu, do the following.

[arabic]
. Select the host you provisioned.
. Click `+Next+`.

.template systems

Click `+Submit+`.

.submit template

Once the template has been created, go back to the System view in the
Patch application.

.patch systems menu
image::patchsystemsmenu.png[patch systems menu]

Click on the system you applied the template to.

.system

You’ll find the patch is greyed out and cannot be applied to your
system. This is because the podman advisory was published after the date
we specified in the Patch template.
