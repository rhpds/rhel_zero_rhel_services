To demonstrate patching, we’ll downgrade `+openssh+` and `+bash+` before
utilizing the patching application. In the `+Terminal+`, run the
following command.

[source,bash]
----
dnf -y downgrade bash openssh
----

Next we’ll run `+insights-client+` to update the host’s metadata status
the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console.

[source,bash]
----
insights-client

Navigate to the `+Systems+` menu in the `+Patch+` application.

Locate your host in the list, based on its private IP address /
hostname. It should have two installable advisories (which are the
packages we just downgraded).

[arabic]
. Select your host.
. Click `+Remediate+`.

You’ll be asked to `+Select playbook+` next. This feature is designed to
enable you to create customized playbooks that include remediations
detected from other Insights applications, like `+Compliance+` for
example.

In other words, you may want to upgrade `+bash+` but then you might also
want to remediate other problems detected by OpenSCAP (through the
`+Compliance+` application).

Create a new playbook.

[arabic]
. Select `+Create a new playbook+` and give it a name. In this example
we’ll call it `+test-001+` (please choose a unique name).
. Click `+Next+`.

Review the correct system is selected and click `+Next+`.

.review systems

Review the remediation and click `+Submit+`. Note that `+Autoreboot+` is
enabled. This can be turned off if desired.

.submit
